## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the Delhi Metro network using various data analysis and visualization techniques. The analysis includes:
- Geospatial distribution of metro stations
- Temporal growth of the metro network
- Characteristics of different metro lines
- Distribution of station layouts

## Installation

To run this analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- folium
- plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy folium plotly
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Delhi_Metro_Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Delhi_Metro_Analysis
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Delhi_Metro_Analysis.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.



## Analysis

### Geospatial Analysis
Visualize the locations of the metro stations on a map to gain insights into their geographical distribution. This includes creating a map with markers for each metro station.

### Temporal Analysis
Analyze the growth of the Delhi Metro network over time by examining the number of stations opened each year and visualizing this data in a bar plot.

### Line Analysis
Evaluate the characteristics of different metro lines, including the number of stations per line and the average distance between stations.

### Station Layout Analysis
Explore the distribution of different station layouts (elevated, ground level, underground) across the network and identify any patterns or trends.

## Observations

- **Geospatial Distribution**: The map shows the spread of metro stations across Delhi, providing a visual understanding of station density and geographic spread.
- **Temporal Growth**: The analysis reveals phases of rapid network expansion and years with few or no new stations.
- **Line Characteristics**: The Blue line has the highest number of stations, while the Green and Grey lines have the fewest.
- **Station Layout**: Elevated stations are the most common, followed by underground and at-grade stations.
